1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React is a JavaScript Library to help build "reactive" UI apps, by using components to break things down into more managable pieces.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

    To think of how to solve problems?

1. Describe state.

    state is what the current "state" of your component is in. It is how you can hold data, and update it in certain ways. In class components, it is part of it already in addition to using component life-cycles, and now with react hooks, you can hold more specific state with much less code.

1. Describe props.

    props are "properties", or data, that can be passed down to other components, so you have access to that data in other subcomponents.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    side effects are things that happen asyncronously(however you spell it)? include the previous class component's life-cycle methods, now you can use one key word for (I think) all of those methods. It uses the key word "useEffect()" ( and probably more I haven't heard of).
